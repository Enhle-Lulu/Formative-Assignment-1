The Read-Me file is meant to guide for an end user to use when wanting to run the program letting them know whatâ€™s needed to run the program. 

 

Below it shows all the look of the app on Android Studio:

REPORT:  

  I have developed an app that provides meal suggestions based on the time of day. The user must input the time of day. User inputs Morning, Mid-morning, Afternoon, Mid-afternoon, Dinner. It will just give meal suggestions based on the time-of-day input. The application accounts for whether the user input time of day with caps or no caps. It has a few options depending on whether the user wants to have something greasy or something rather light. This is easier because you can easily play inky-pinky-ponk-kie on what the user would enjoy based on their taste buds that day. Although it is restricted, it does still give the user a choice based off what they feel like.
